AvaloniaNDI

======

Output NDI® from your Avalonia application window!

A crude port of the WPF sample code from the NewTek NDI® 5 SDK.

## Project Status: Experimental

I have not done much testing. This code is likely wildly inefficient. I have not tested audio.

But it works well enough to send out frames correctly, with alpha channel!!

From a cursory glance, performance is quite acceptable... it can only improve from here, right? :) :) :)

## How to use

Be sure to copy `Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll` to the build output folder
